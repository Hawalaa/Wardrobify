## Shoes microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.

## Hats microservice

Created two models LocationVO and Hat. LocationVO model is used to pull a instance data of the Location model from the wardrobe microservice, and Hat model is used to create a hat data.
Also two view functions are created to handle "GET", "POST", and "DELETE" requests.
